Client The Fitness Lab Miami Crosssfit Gym 

This Freelancing project is my initiave towards creating my business model of merging my branding Photography skills and AI Marketing in one package as *AI-photo-marketing as a service*. 
I would love to help local businesses or startups to thrive in the AI era and keep being a supporting pillar for the community and the local economy. I leveraged Stakeholder relationships, sales techniques, personal branding, customer service, technical knowledge of AI tools, tech knowledge of Marketing Campaigns performances, Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
I presented a brandnew personalized marketing idea to my client and he loved it. We started today as of 02/10/2024. 

This is how his only social media page looks right now.

### I have divided this project into 3 main parts to make it affordable for small and start up businesses, and a 4th phase as optional: 

#### 1- Photoshoot and video session: Himself, his business and performing his job.
#### 2- Website design and creation
#### 3- Ad creatives and content creation 
#### 4- Ads Management plan

I will describe every phase and tool I used to make this project a sucessful story of a local business thriving and growing its clients.
