Client The Fitness Lab Miami CrossFit Gym 

This is my first freelancing project as initiave towards creating my business model of merging my branding Photography and AI Marketing in one package as *AI-photo-marketing as a service*. Using powerful tools from Generative AI and my Photography skills and tech skills I can bring this to live easier more than ever before. 

I would love to help local businesses or startups to thrive in the AI era so they can keep being a supporting pillar for the community and the local economy. 

I leveraged Stakeholder relationships, sales techniques, personal branding, customer service, technical knowledge of AI tools, tech knowledge of Marketing Campaigns performances, Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Market data analysis, technological proficiency and technical writing skills. 


I presented a brandnew personalized marketing idea to support my client on his marketing goals. I guaranteed amazing resulting in a satisfactory Return of Investment of %100 in the first 2 months and all his profit in the months ahead.
He loved it. We started right away today as of 02/10/2024.
